# Distance
This calculates the distance between any two Indian places using the Google Maps that scraps down the Json file and gives the output as a distance and time taken to reach between places. This is a module my AI uses to tell the distances between two places for the approximation of journey. I have added as a repository to share for other to use.#journeymadeeasy
